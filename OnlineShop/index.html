                <h3>ABOUT</h3>
                <p>Jaecheondaeseong is one of the 9 kings of the monsters and ruler of the monkey kingdom. The current Jaecheondaeseong has learned many skills from humans in his 17 years of dormancy. These include Renewal Tae-Kwon-Do, Bongchim-na acupuncture, and beggars song staff style. He uses the staff Yeoui as his main weapon. Yeoui is a stone pillar that Jaecheondaeseong got from the Dragon King in the Dragon King's Palace. Yeoui can increase its size and weight in an instant on Jaecheondaeseong's command. It has the power to kill hundreds of lesser gods in an instant and has reached all the way from Earth to the Moon. Jaecheondaeseong also has Geundoowun. Geundoowun follows Jaecheondaeseong's orders and can electrocute his enemies, carry Jaecheondaeseong on it at great speeds, and can be used for a distraction. His final weapon is the Gourd Bottle. The Gourd Bottle can absorb almost anything at will and can hold an unlimited amount of people/items. Defensively Jaecheondaeseong has his armorsuits and their different forms. These include, standard, speed, and power mode. The standard mode is it's all round form while speed mode can increase Jaecheondaeseong's speed to ludicrous amounts. The power mode gives him greatly increased defense and striking power while lowering his speed. These armorsuits can be moved to protect other people other than Jaecheondaeseong. His Noble Phantasm is The Weapon of The Three Gods. This attack combines yeoui, Geundoowun, and the Gourd Bottle together to unleash a great blast that can match multiple high tier named gods full power attacks all at the same time. It is the only thing to have ever broken the Gourd Bottle as even the first prince of Natak a god of fight couldn't. His feats include destroying Tam (Avarice) multiple times, defeating the first prince of Natak, defeating Pandora, defeating Hojosa the Nine-tailed Fox, and defeating all of the gods of the first and second heavenly realms single handedly. He has survived world disintegrating explosions and the rebound from a temporary X250,000 power boost by using an acupuncture technique. He can fully understand and preform other forms of attacks and martial arts after seeing it once.</p>
